# PDF Form Filler

This repository contains the Python code to fill forms in PDF using two different methods. The code was taken from different sources and adapted to work according to my requirements.

## Method 1: Form Field Text Update

This method uses a pdf form with fields created in Adobe Acrobat DC or similar software and those fields are filled through Python code. The way I created the fields in the pdf file was through a free site online: <https://www.pdfescape.com>

## Method 2: Text Overlay

This method uses an empty pdf file. The Python code creates a new layer with the text you want to map to the pdf file and it is finally overlayed to one layer.
